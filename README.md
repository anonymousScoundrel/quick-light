# Quick Light
A small android flash light app with minimal permissions.

This app was born out of a desire to learn how to make a proper Android app as well as frustration at how sluggish or bloated many Android flash light apps are.

I started work on this in July 2014 and reached an initial alpha stage by August. Sometime in October or November my phone upgraded to Android Lollipop.

Lollipop comes with a built in flash light app.:sob:
