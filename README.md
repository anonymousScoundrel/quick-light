# Quick Light
A small android flash light app with minimal permissions.

This app was born out of a desire to learn how to make a proper Android app as well as frustration at how sluggish or bloated many Android flash light apps are.

I started work on this in July 2014 and reached an initial alpha stage by August. Sometime in October or November my phone upgraded to Android Lollipop.

Lollipop comes with a built in flash light app.:sob:

That being said, the app is still available to test out. It's still in Alpha in the play store so if you'd like a chance to test it out, head over to https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.null_cipher.quicklight.
